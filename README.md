# Oscar Penning Fleet

**Engineer who likes to be bad at a wide array of different topics**

I'm currently working on:
- Learning Rust and embedded programming (micro:bit, Raspberry Pi Pico, ESP32)
- Autonomous rover with CV (using the IMX500)
- Trying to fix a Bulova Accutron Spaceview
- Working at [Gradial](https://www.gradial.com/) building AI Agents for marketing ops. RE for our entire Sitecore product (XM Cloud, Content Hub, etc.) + do lots of work related to design system data representation + agent framework (which is bleeding into an OS-style paradigm!)

My general background:
- BA in Computer Science from Middlebury College, with minors in Philosophy and German
- Studied international humanitarian law, ethics, and machine learning in the German language at the University of Potsdam
- Projects in cryptography and quantum computing. Built an Enigma machine emulator. Learned Q#, Microsoft's quantum computing language and implemented some algos to run in Azure Quantum
- Worked for my college's General Counsel in projects relating to Free Speech, Demonstrations, and responses to the SFFA v. Harvard, SFFA v. UNC Supreme Court rulings
- Bravely led and wrote for the Local Noodle, Middlebury's only news source ([satire publication](https://the-local-noodle.com/))
- Briefly worked on software for lumbermills across the country (knot identification in cants to optimize profitability of cuts)
- Build watches in my free time; generally limited to assembly + modding. Tried to build an NH38 movement from parts once and it drove me insane and worked for 2 days. Very poor ROI
